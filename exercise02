			<h2>Introduction</h2> 
			<p>Hi, my name is Yosgarth and I am an undergrad student at Dominican University. My major is <b>informatics</b> with a minor in <b>computer science</b>. I have a passion for learing code and wanting to dive into cybersecurity world. I am from Oaxaca, Mexico but I have lived in Indiana almost my whole life. I have only one sibiling who is just 1 year younger than me. He plans to major in computer science, similar to what I am planning to do only because I was able to talk him into it.  </p>

			<h2>My Family</h2>
			<p>I have only one brother who is just 1 year younger than me. He is 17 turning 18 in July and is planning to attend <b>Saint Louis University</b> with a major in <b>computer science,</b> similar to what I am planning to do. I was able to talk him into taking computer science with me. Both my parents are still in there late 30s which is pretty cool. I also have 2 dogs which we got as gifts from some of my dad's friends. One is a pure bred German Shepard named <b>Hades</b> and the other is an Akita/Pitbull mix named <b>Cuervo.</b> <i> His original name was Ice but we thought since he is our dog now we could change it! </i></p>

			<h2>My Childhood</h2>
			<p>I grew up on the westiside of Indiana and have lived in 3 different houses thoughtout my life. The first one was with my aunt and uncle who had allowed us to live with them as my parents made money for a home. The second house we had was a small 2 story house on a circlular dead end that me and my borther would spend a lot of our time riding our bikes and kicking a ball around. Our third and final home that we currently live in has been my home since I started elementary school. I grew up with lots of friends from different backgrounds which really gave me a sense of love and appreciation for everyone around me. </p>
